		Phelan has experience in User Interface design and creating beautiful web-pages. An artist, his work has been displayed in local art exhibits in Burlington, VT, as well as on the walls of his friends and family. His work isn't just flashy though, systems designed by Phelan follow proper DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principles and other well established design idioms.
