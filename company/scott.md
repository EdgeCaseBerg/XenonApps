<p>Lord of JavaScript and the almighty if-statement, Scott currently works as a full-stack web developer.
	He spends most of his work days creating custom web applications, often with in-house PHP frameworks, but 
	no matter the tools, Scott's greatest asset is his ability to analyze and solve problems creatively and efficiently.

<p>When he's not furiously writing code, Scott can be found enjoying the outdoors, playing video games, or broadening his palette for craft beer and scotch whisky, often accompanied by his girlfriend and their dog, Washburn.</p>
