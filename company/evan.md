<p>
		Evan started programming on his TI-83+ graphing calculator in highschool because he got tired of entering the same complex equations over and over again.  This desire to eliminate tedious labor from his and others' lives, combined with a lifelong interest in learning how things work has given Evan knowledge in a wide range of topics which he is eager to apply.

		Attentive to detail to the point of obsession and persistent in pursuing solutions to complex problems;  Evan currently does scripting work and database maintenence. In his off hours he enjoys reading, tinkering with software and learning more about whatever he finds most interesting at the moment.
